## Project background

Booking.com regularly hosts design meet-ups with special guests from all over the world. This time it was Vitaly Friedman â€” the co-founder and editor-in-chief of <a class="c-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine<svg class="o-icon  c-icon--external"><use xlink:href="#external"></use></svg></a>. IT recruitement asked me to create a video about the event. It was later used on hiring platforms including our own <a class="c-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.workingatbooking.com/">www.workingatbooking.com<svg class="o-icon  c-icon--external"><use xlink:href="#external"></use></svg></a>.


## My role

I took care of producing the video from start to finish. On the day of the event I used lunch break to capture b-roll around the office. Just before the event started, I had a change to record the interview with Vitaly. Finally, during the event itself I ran around with a camera and tried to capture the atmosphere. I then edited and color corrected the clip on the weekend. 


## Photography

Below are some photos I took around the office while location scouting and filming the B-roll.
