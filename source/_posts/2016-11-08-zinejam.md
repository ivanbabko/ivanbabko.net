## Project background

Zine Jam is an event that takes place every year in different venues of Amsterdam. It is a celebration of self-publishing and DIY book-making. I was commissioned by non-profit organization ReKult﻿ to make short film about the event. 


## My role

I was given complete creative freedom to produce a video that would convey the quirky spirit of the zine scene. As a one man band I was in charge of the production and post-production processes.


## Zine Jam 2014

A year after the first video was made, I was approached by the folks from ReKult to make another one. This time Zine Jam took place within the hallowed halls of Felix Meritis – building with a soul that deserves a documentary of its own. In this sequel video I focused a but more on the members of the ReKult group, but also did not forget about the artists from all over the world who came to showcase their zines.

## Wrap-up

Once the event was over and the doors were closed, we could finally breath out. After a few beers, the cleanup turned into an impromptu photo session with the ReKult group.
