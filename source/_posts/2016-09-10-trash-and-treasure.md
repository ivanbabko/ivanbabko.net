## Project background

As part of the Booking Cares initiative, our colleagues partnered with Plastic Whaleï»¿ Foundation. They set out on a mission together to clean the canal belt from plastic waste. The clean-up happened in August right after the Gay Pride which meant that there was a lot of plastic to pick-up. 


## My role

I took part in the project as a videographer. I cruised in one of the boats with my camera gear and tried not to drown it. Later I edited the clip in my spare time.
