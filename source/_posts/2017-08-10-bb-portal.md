## Final screens

The biggest feedback from the team was that the design had to be easily maintainable without designer's involvement. For example, landing page icons looked pretty, but this wasn't a scalable solution in the long run. We decided to uses colors instead of icons to differentiate sections.

## Prototype

To better present the design, I created prototype bringing all screens together.
