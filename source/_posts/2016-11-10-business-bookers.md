## Project background

When Booking.com for Business just emerged, there was a lot of interest from around the company. Booking annual meeting (BAM) was a great opportunity to satisfy this interest. To make our BAM presentation more fun, we decided to kick it off with a comedy film depicting frustrations of business customers. It was a nice segway into the keynote about business travel and our product.



## My role

I wrote <a target="blank" class="c-link  c-hint--top" aria-label="View on Google Drive" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sq90epctpb9-z2Pnf_ZBzwMCW812m3XRsfQsi69NaXM/edit?usp=sharing">the screenplay<svg class="o-icon  c-icon--external"><use xlink:href="#external"></use></svg></a>, found actors in our development team, and directed the movie. I worked with an assistant, a camera operator, and an editor from an external agency. 


## Insipration

I was inspired by the first season of the TV show True Detective that aired at that time. Particularly by the plot structure where both main characters were interviewed about past events. This lead to an idea to make a mockumentary (fake documentary) about a business trip gone wrong.

## Behind the scenes

I thought it would be fun to create a 'making of' video, so I was carrying my camera with me during the whole day. This allowed me to capture in-between moments of the production process. In the video below, first you see the scene from the final movie and then how it was made.

 We had just one day to shoot all scenes from the script. I don't know how we pulled it off, but we managed to wrap-up within a day.


## Big premiere

Business Bookers presentation at BAM was held in the largest auditorium available in RAI Convention Centre. We couldn't believe how big it was. It felt like we were screening our film in the actual movie theatre. We were a bit anxious, but when we turned the video on everyone was laughing, so we relaxed and enjoyed the experience.
